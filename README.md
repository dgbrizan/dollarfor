# Helping the volunteer organisation DollarFor?

We (Terence Lin, Justin Le and I) got some data from the [University of North Carolina](https://www.shepscenter.unc.edu/programs-projects/rural-health/data/). [Our notebook](https://github.com/dgbrizan/dollarfor/blob/main/DF%20-%20Hospitals.ipynb) has the following findings:

* There's no overlap between Acute and Specialty tabs in 2020 data
* Some hospitals are located in remote islands outside the United States, and some hospitals have a ID combination of letters and numbers as well as missing some data.
* Dropped some columns to make the data more consistent in regards to data typing for both frames

David Koosis also has [a data file](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZpFeQ7lZLj9k8XhC-sBquK5PmIt4b0uzRkpO8X-JfPA/edit?usp=sharing). Next steps:

1. Understand this data and its sources
2. Determine the overlap between the UNC data and Koosis' many files.
